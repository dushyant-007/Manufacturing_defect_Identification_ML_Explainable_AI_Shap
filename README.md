# Manufacturing_defect_Identification_ML_Explainable_AI_Shap

In this project, we are trying to use Machine Learning for fault Diagnosis. We have data for Snaking ( A defect or abnormility ), and we are trying to determine the target strength of the pipe so as to reduce it as much as we can.

## File specifications - 

1. learning_curva_and_pareto_chart.py - This is where all the data processing and model training is happening. Visualization are also provided here. 
2. generate random samples- this is the file that was used to generate the data for data analysis. These parameters were passed into the simulaiton model. 
3. Snaking_June_2020 (1).csv - data file. contains input strength and output abnormality quantization. 
4. Snaking_random_Jan2021.csv - same as (3)
5. box plots premitive.py - custom library for generating box plots. 
6. Manufacturing_SHAP_application_Explainable_AI.pptx - Presentaion detailing the work. (Please start with this)

### Project Work was performed underguidance from Prof. Milani, UBC Kelowna and Mr. Milad Ramezhankhani, UBC, Kelowna. I thank them for their guidance and support.
